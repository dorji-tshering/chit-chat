# My first [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project is a NextJs version of ReactJs Twitter Clone which you can find [here](https://getstream.io/blog/build-twitter-clone/). If you want to try out for yourself, you can get all the instructions from there. I had to make some code changes especially with `react-router` and navigations options since NextJs has its own implementation of the library. Apart from the tutorial, I have added the simulation of user login and logout just like you see on twitter.

## Want to try it out?

First fork the repo, create a [getstream](https://getstream.io/) account, and follow the tutorial(link mentioned above) to edit the tokens of the users inside `user.js`.
After that, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the app right away. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
